                that I
                am doing a course on web devlopment. I am
                still
                new to programming world but I will try my best.I may lack in skill but I am motivated. I am also
                willing to work hard. Because I really think programming is fun. Well as long
                as
                it works that is.</p>

            <h3>To become a pro devloper</h3>
            <p class="dis">One day I want buid a site or an app with an unique idea and is useful to people. I want to learn
                programming very well. I would like to have higher degrees if possible. But I will not leave my country
                permanently. I belive those with higher education owe something to the country so it's not nice to fly
                away as soon as you graduate.</p>
